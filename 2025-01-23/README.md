# HTML and JS DOM manipulation for table

## Overview
This project showcases how to use HTML, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation to build an interactive table creation tool. Users can define the table's dimensions, generate it dynamically, and modify it with features like adding/removing rows and applying visual themes.

## Tasks Done

### 1. Table Creation
- Built a dynamic table generator using JavaScript and DOM methods.
- Users can input the desired number of rows and columns to create a custom table.
- The table includes headers and content-filled.
- Implemented logic to clear any existing table before generating a new one.

### 2. Theming Options
- Added a dropdown menu with multiple styling options:
  - **Light Theme**: white background with soft blue styling.
  - **Dark Theme**: black background with teal table styling.
- The theme selections update both the table and page appearance instantly.
